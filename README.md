## Description 

Hosts, DIY chefs, and home bartenders alike know the struggle of coming up with a meal to cook for themselves or a cocktail to impress their guests. Menu Match is designed to streamline the process of finding a recipe, shopping for ingredients, and preparing a great meal. 

___________________________________________________________________________

📐Some of the technical features on the Menu Match application include: 

🍊 A landing page that features a random cocktail and meal, for those nights when you just can't decide what to make.

🍊 A search page that allows you to search cocktails or meals by name or ingredient. 

🍊 Display and manage a list of saved recipes. Items displayed on the recipe card can be saved to the shopping list. 

🍊 A shopping list that allows the user to sort items in the list to match their grocery store path. Items can be deleted from the list once they are put in the user's cart.

🍊 jQuery was used to make all API calls to Meal DB and CocktailDB.

🎨 Some notes on the design:

🥂 We used Bootstrap for our nav bar, footer, and display and recipe cards. 

🥂 The grid system is used on every page to ensure maximum mobile responsiveness.

🥂 A custom color palette was created in coolors.io with blue's to give the user a calming aesthetic (after all, hosting can be stressful sometimes). We also incorporated the warm orange and yellow for small elements and the logo to add dimension and excitement to the pages. 

🥂 Karla is used a header font for simplicity and readability. Inconsolata is used for body items such as ingredients, and shopping list items. The monospace is a nod to vintage recipe cards and cookbooks.
